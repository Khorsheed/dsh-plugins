 * job — by {@link deriveExperimentStatus}, which is the only place the rule

 *
 * - `draft` — a plan file exists and validate has not passed (or never ran).
 * - `pending-approval` — validate passed and nobody has started it.
 * - `running` — the job is live, or cells are still moving.
 * - `judging` — every player cell reached `judged` or beyond, and the run is
 *   not finalized: what is left is the judge's and the human's.
 * - `done` — every player cell is `released`.
 * - `refused` — the job settled as failed (the readiness gate is the usual
 *   reason, and the usual one leaves no run in the ledger at all).
 * - `cancelled` — the job was killed.
