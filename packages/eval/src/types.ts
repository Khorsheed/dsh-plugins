/**
 * The eval orchestrator's WIRE vocabulary — the types its Remote face passes
 * over the boundary, exported through the `./types` subpath so the Typert
 * wire-schema generator resolves them from a public non-root path.
 *
 * Everything here is plain JSON. The run's own report types stay internal:
 * what crosses this boundary is a run's IDENTITY (job id, run id), its
 * lifecycle, and its log lines — the three things a caller outside the
 * instance (a CI runner) needs to start a run, watch it, and stop it.
