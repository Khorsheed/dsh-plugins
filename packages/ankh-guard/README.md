# dsh-ankh-guard

English | [中文](README.zh.md)

Let an agent change its own code and restart its own service — without taking the whole thing down.

When the agent wants to restart after editing code, this plugin asks one question first: did the build and tests pass? Yes, go ahead. No, blocked — so broken code can't take the service, and the conversation running inside it, down with it.

## How it works

One rule at the core: **prove the code is good before you allow a restart.**

After a green build and tests, the plugin records a credential bound to the current git commit, valid for 10 minutes (`maxAgeMinutes`). On a restart request it checks three things:

1. does a credential exist;
2. is it younger than `maxAgeMinutes`;
3. does the current HEAD match the commit the credential was recorded on — any change after recording invalidates it.

That one rule catches a whole class of incidents: broken builds, missed config registration, wrong imports — all of these fail the build/typecheck, so no credential exists and the restart is refused before it can hurt.

A green build still says nothing about the profile composition: bad patch YAML, a missing built file, a duplicate loader entry id, a typert manifest ownership mismatch, a plugin whose apply throws — all of these fail only at boot. So a second gate runs after the credential check, before anything is stopped: `preflight` deep-dry-runs the exact composition in a subprocess (full plugin tree booted through the same engine, then disposed), and a composition that does not boot means the running instance is never stopped. See [preflight: the composition gate](#preflight-the-composition-gate).

The restart itself is handed to a watchdog: a detached supervisor that brings the host back if it dies, rolls back to the last known-good revision (the healthy-boot stamp — the last revision that actually came up in this deployment — else the checkpoint, else the green credential's HEAD) if it can't come up — skipping the rollback when the boot failure originates outside the repository — and stops at a crash page after four consecutive failures. Every rollback leaves `guard-backup-*` recovery anchors for the discarded HEAD and any uncommitted work. `checkpoint` commits the whole working tree as a rollback point before a batch, `reset` hard-resets to it (anchored the same way), and `canary` re-verifies after a restart. Checkpoints and credentials persist in a state file that survives restarts, so the canary runs after the new instance is up.

## Install and load

This package is a dsh plugin: it guards a running dsh web instance against broken self-modification restarts. It is published to npm as **`@khorsheed/dsh-ankh-guard`** (the community channel — the `Khorsheed/dsh-ankh-guard` repo is the publish source); inside the deepseek-harness monorepo the same code is the `@deepseek-ai/dsh-ankh-guard` family member at `packages/guard/ankh-guard`, mounted by the base bundle. **Official dsh images therefore already mount it — do not also plugin-add it there** (a duplicate loader entry id fails boot). For a composition that does not include it, install the host and add the plugin as a profile bundle:

```sh
npm install @deepseek-ai/dsh                                 # the host (dsh web / dsh CLI)
dsh plugin --profile web add @khorsheed/dsh-ankh-guard       # this plugin
```

The package declares `dsh.bundle`, so the add reconciles its `cordis.patch.yml` row (a bare `ankh-guard` mount) into the profile's bundles layer — no hand-edited cordis.yml. From source: clone the monorepo; the package lives at `packages/guard/ankh-guard` (`pnpm install && pnpm run build`).

Config (all optional): `stateDir` (default `$DSH_HOME/state`, else `<cwd>/.dsh-guard-state`), `repoDir` (default the process cwd), `maxAgeMinutes` (credential freshness, default 10), `reportRestartContext` (`followup` autonomous report / `step` ride the next turn / `off`, default `followup`), `resumeInterrupted` (resume restart-interrupted sessions and queue a continue turn, default true), `resumeDelayMs` (default 5000), `resumeMaxSnapshotAgeMs` (default 600000).

Runtime needs: `node`, `bash`, `lsof` on macOS/Linux for listener discovery (`--pid` bypasses it). No build step for consumers — the published `lib/` is the runnable artifact.

## CLI

The primary interface is the CLI, usable even when the instance is down. Use the `dsh-ankh-guard` bin (or `node lib/cli.js`). Every command takes `--state-dir "$DSH_HOME/state" --repo "$PWD"`.

```sh
dsh-ankh-guard verify      # is it safe to restart right now
dsh-ankh-guard record build+test   # green build & tests → record the credential
dsh-ankh-guard checkpoint --message "what changed"   # checkpoint before editing
dsh-ankh-guard preflight   # deep dry-run: does the profile composition boot
dsh-ankh-guard canary --port 3080   # confirm after restart
dsh-ankh-guard supervise --port 3080 --start "CMD"   # hand the port to a watchdog
```

Full commands: `verify`, `record`, `status`, `clear`, `checkpoint`, `reset`, `canary`, `preflight`, `restart`, `schedule-exit`, `supervise`.

### preflight: the composition gate

`preflight` deep-dry-runs the exact composition a restart would boot: it composes the profile's full patch stack through the same path as the real launcher (bundle layers, user layers, overlays), boots the **whole plugin tree** in a subprocess through the same engine — every plugin's apply runs, because apply is activation — with an overlay pinning the webserver port to 0 (OS-assigned, so it never collides with the live instance), checks every registered client bundle artifact exists, and disposes (registrations are effects, so dispose rolls the dry-run back). Exit codes are the contract:

- `0` — the composition boots clean.
- `1` — a composition verdict: the tree a restart would boot is broken; the output names the failing layer.
- `3` — preflight itself could not execute (missing app layout, infrastructure crash) — **not** a verdict on the composition.

`schedule-exit` and `restart` run this gate after the credential check, before anything is stopped. A composition failure refuses with the preflight's diagnostics; an infrastructure failure also refuses — worded differently and with the manual override (stop the instance by hand, let the watchdog respawn it) — because the guard will not stop a healthy instance it cannot prove will come back. Outside the dsh app layout (a standalone published install) there is no profile to check: the gate warns once and proceeds. Flags: `--profile NAME` (default `$DSH_PROFILE`, else `web`) and `--preflight-timeout-ms MS` (default 120000); `DSH_PREFLIGHT_COMMAND` replaces the resolved app bin wholesale (test hook). Run it by hand any time with `dsh-ankh-guard preflight --profile web`.

### The self-restart protocol

Six steps for a safe restart after editing code:

1. **checkpoint** — snapshot the working tree as the rollback point: `dsh-ankh-guard checkpoint --message "<batch>"`
2. **modify** — make the change; register every surface it needs (aggregates, paths, bundle rows, dependencies).
3. **build + test** — the narrow full set for the changed surface; no green, no credential.
4. **record** — `dsh-ankh-guard record build+test --command "<what went green>"`
5. **verify** — `dsh-ankh-guard verify` must exit 0; a denial (missing/stale/HEAD-mismatched credential) means rebuild and re-record.
6. **restart + canary** — after the new instance is up, `dsh-ankh-guard canary --port N` confirms it.

### supervise: seamless restart

`restart` runs the whole kill → start → probe → canary loop in one CLI process (use `--delay-ms` so the scheduling turn finishes first). For deployments where nobody should touch a terminal, `supervise` hands the job to a **watchdog** — a detached supervisor process that survives the instance:

```sh
dsh-ankh-guard supervise --port 3080 --start "CMD" --state-dir "$DSH_HOME/state" --repo "$PWD"
```

It spawns `scripts/dsh-watchdog.sh` (ships with the package) detached with `--wait-owner`: the watchdog idles while the current instance runs, takes over the port when the instance exits (intentional restart or crash), respawns it, runs the guard canary on intentional restarts (a `restart-requested.json` marker), and clears the marker on pass. Two consecutive boot failures roll the checkout back to the last known-good revision — the healthy-boot stamp (`last-good-boot.json`, written every time the instance comes up, so it names the last revision that genuinely ran in this deployment), else the guard checkpoint, else the credential's HEAD — but only when the boot failure's error subject is a path inside the repository: a broken profile overlay or installed plugin cannot be fixed by reverting the checkout, so that failure class skips the rollback entirely. Every reset (watchdog, CLI, or service) first creates `guard-backup-*` branch anchors for the discarded HEAD and for uncommitted tracked changes, so recovery never depends on the reflog. Four failures serve a crash page on the port with a retry button (SIGUSR1 to the watchdog). A `watchdog-stop` marker exits the watchdog for good. The instance itself can adopt supervision before a self-restart — the user never starts the watchdog by hand.

When a watchdog is already supervising, the restart trigger is `schedule-exit`: it writes the restart marker and spawns a detached exit agent (setsid via node `spawn`), which cannot be reaped by a managed shell's process group, so the scheduled kill actually lands after the scheduling turn ends (the fix for `(sleep N; kill) &` silently never firing). The watchdog respawns, runs the canary, and the new instance reports via `last-restart.json`. Prefer `restart` (single-shot loop) only when no watchdog is present.

**The restart report reaches the model by itself — and waits for its owner.** After a scheduled restart (a pending `last-restart.json` record), the plugin queues the report as the next turn via `agent.followup` — the official wake-the-agent seam the schedule system uses for reminders — so the agent reports the restart result without any user message. Session restore after a restart is lazy (an agent is created only when the UI or an RPC touches the session), so the report goes ONLY to the session that scheduled the exit (`schedule-exit` records `$DSH_SESSION_ID` as the initiator), whenever it resumes — no other session is ever woken for reporting, and the record stays pending until its owner resumes or the next restart replaces it (new `exitAt`). A record without an initiator is claimed by the first root agent created. Only root agents, once (acknowledged on delivery). Config `reportRestartContext`: `followup` (default, autonomous), `step` (ride the first step of whatever turn comes next), or `off`.

**Interrupted sessions resume and continue by themselves.** At SIGTERM the plugin snapshots which root sessions had a live turn (plus the restart's initiator) into `interrupted-sessions.json`; on the next restart boot — a cold start drops the snapshot — it resumes those sessions via `ctx.agents.resume` and queues a "continue" followup for the interrupted ones (their logs were closed with `reason.kind === 'interrupted'` by crash-recovery repair), so a self-restart no longer silently pauses every other session. Config `resumeInterrupted` (default true) and `resumeDelayMs` (default 5000, lets the app's services come up first).

### supervise: one port, one owner

A port must have exactly one supervision owner, but the owner itself should be supervised. Three deployment shapes:

- **A — pure guard**: no external supervisor; the instance adopts the watchdog via `supervise` before a self-restart. Simplest, but nothing pulls the host back after an unexpected crash.
- **B — pure launchd/systemd**: the launcher owns the port with KeepAlive. Solid for crashes, but self-modification restarts are not guarded by the credential gate.
- **C — layered (recommended)**: launchd supervises the watchdog, the watchdog supervises the instance. One owner per port, and the owner is supervised. Run the watchdog in the foreground:

```sh
# launchd/systemd job (KeepAlive) runs this; the CLI process IS the watchdog:
dsh-ankh-guard supervise --foreground --port 3093 --start "<start command>" \
  --state-dir "$DSH_HOME/state" --repo "<checkout>"
```

`--foreground` runs the watchdog inline (adopting the port) and exits with it, so a dead watchdog triggers the external supervisor's restart. The detached form (`supervise` without `--foreground`) is for the instance adopting supervision ahead of a self-restart.

The checkpoint/rollback round trip:

```sh
dsh-ankh-guard checkpoint --message "before batch"
# ... modify, build, test, record, verify ...
dsh-ankh-guard canary --port 3080   # fails → roll back
dsh-ankh-guard reset <checkpoint-sha>
```

`restart` owns the whole restart loop in a detached process that outlives the restarted instance. It refuses to stop the instance when the gate denies (the credential check is enforced in the restart path itself, not just by procedure), stops the listener on `--port`, starts the `--start` command detached, polls until the port listens, re-verifies, and with `--rollback` hard-resets to the recorded checkpoint when the new instance never comes up:

```sh
dsh-ankh-guard restart \
  --port 3080 --start "DSH_HOME=$HOME/.dsh-official pnpm dsh web" --rollback \
  --state-dir "$DSH_HOME/state" --repo "$PWD"
```

Mounted as a cordis plugin (base bundle), the same surface is available as the `selfRestartGuard` service for in-app gates. Config: `maxAgeMinutes` (default 10), `stateDir`, `repoDir`, `reportRestartContext` (default `followup`), `fallbackGraceMs` (default 300000).

## Model Experience

None. The guard is host-side infrastructure; it adds no tool schema, prompt, or result to any model request.

#### KV Cache effect

None.

## Known Limitations and Deferred Work

- **The gate is enforced in `restart`/`supervise`, not the launcher** — both refuse to stop the instance on a denial, but a manual `kill`/start outside the guard still bypasses it; the watchdog is the automatic safety net that makes a bypassed gate recoverable.
- **The preflight dry-run cannot see the boot-time world** — it proves the composition applies and disposes cleanly, not the restart instant: environment divergence between the preflight subprocess and the real boot, a port taken at the restart moment, real persistent state (databases, session logs a boot migrates), and post-apply timing all remain outside its view. The watchdog's rollback-to-known-good stays the net for that territory.
- **A preflight infrastructure failure blocks restarts by design** — a subprocess that cannot produce a verdict is treated as "unproven", not "probably fine"; the refusal message names the manual exit path (kill the listener by hand; the watchdog respawns).
- **A SIGKILL crash writes no interrupted-session snapshot** — interrupted-session auto-continue covers graceful stops (SIGTERM: scheduled exits, watchdog takeovers); crash-interrupted sessions still resume lazily on open.
- **The watchdog needs a supervisor to outlive the instance** — `supervise` spawns it detached (setsid); a watchdog spawned from inside a process that is about to die must be orphaned first, so the app adopts supervision *before* exiting.
- **The guard watches the checkout, not who else works on it** — concurrent self-modifying sessions share the tree; rollbacks are anchored and recoverable, but nothing serializes the sessions themselves.
- **Checkpoint commits sweep the whole working tree** — intended (a checkpoint is a full rollback point), but note it also captures unrelated uncommitted work.
- **`restart`/`supervise` discover the listener via `lsof`** (macOS/Linux with lsof); other platforms need `--pid`.
